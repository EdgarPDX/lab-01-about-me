            Hobbies
        </h3>
            
        <div class= "hobbies">
                I have three main hobbies listed below. 
                Photography has been something I was always interested in since I was young. About 3 years ago, I decided that I should take the hobby more seriously and 
                so I purchased my first real "PRO" camera. Once I became comfortable with taking and editing photos
                I saw that video should be something else I should explore. Videography is more complicated in my opinion
                as it is more work and with photography you are just working with one image. Cooking was something that I learned from watching
                my parents. Growing up my parents were always catering for quinceneras and weddings. I never thought that
                I would love cooking as much as I do since I hate washing dishes, but I must love cooking that much.

            Goals
        </h4>
        <div class="goals">
            Being unemployed during this pandemic made it possible
            for me to enroll in this program. I heard about Alchemy from my brother
            which sparked my interest. When I began my research into the program it seemed like something I would
            love to. However I did not have the time or money to take on such a big risk. It took
            something like a pandemic to give it another look. Here we are two years later and I am enrolled and happy. Moving
            forward, i want to start creating goals for myself. Listed below are my goals during/after Alchemy.
